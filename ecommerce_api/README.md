# E-commerce Product API

This project is a backend API for an e-commerce platform, built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. It supports product management, user authentication, and product search functionality. The API is designed to mimic the responsibilities of a backend developer in a real-world e-commerce environment.
